# ML-to-predict-Illegal-fishing-off-U.S.-west-coast
 This repo includes the Python code to (1) train and test two classification models to discriminate landings records that originated from federal-only versus state-only fishing trips, and (2) the data used to train and test the models

This repo is in support of this manuscript: "Catch compositions support machine learning-based prediction of illegal groundfish fishing off U.S. west coast"
