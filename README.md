# ML-to-predict-Illegal-fishing-off-U.S.-west-coast
This repo includes the Python code to (1) train and test two classification models to discriminate landings records that originated from federal-only versus state-only fishing trips, and (2) the data used to train and test the models. The datasets are of West Coast commercial landings by fixed gear vessels between 2002 and 2019. These particular landings were linked to observer data in order to create the labels (i.e., Federal waters = 1, and state waters = 0). These data (weights of five species, landing receipt totals, and distances from port to sablefish fishing grounds) were normalized and do not include identifiable elements in order to protect confidentiality. The code and data found in this repo support the findings and conclusions established in this manuscript: "Catch compositions support machine learning-based prediction of illegal groundfish fishing off U.S. west coast"
